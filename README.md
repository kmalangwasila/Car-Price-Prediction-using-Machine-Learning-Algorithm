Predicting Car prices using Machine Learning Algorithms. Evaluating the Models, Random Forest stood out with(R2) R-squared of 0.73. The random forest model achieved the highest R-squared score among all models on the test set, approximately 0.73. This suggests that the model effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data, explaining around 73% of the variance in the target variable. 
In summary:
Linear Regression: R-2 (r-squared): 0.254288 Interpretation: On the test set, the linear regression model's R-squared score was comparatively low, at about 0.25. This shows that the independent variables in the model may account for about 25.43% of the variance in the regressand, Price, which is the Target variable.

SVM (R2) R-squared: -0.010680 Interpretation: With a negative R-squared value, the SVR model underperformed compared to a model that only forecasted the target variable's mean. This shows that the underlying patterns in the data were not adequately captured by the SVR model

KNN: R2 (squared): 0.366500 Interpretatio: On the test set, the KNN model obtained a moderate R-squared score of about 0.37 This indicates that the model can account for about 36.65% of the variance in the target variable, which is a respectable but not very high level of performance. n..

Decision Tree R2 (squared): 0.6580 Interpretation: On the test set, the decision tree model's R-squared score was a comparatively high 0.66. This suggests that the independent variables in the model account for approximately 65.83% of the variance in the target variable. Performance of the model was much better than that of SVR and LR

Random Forest: (R2) R-squared: 0.73 The random forest model achieved the highest R-squared score among all models on the test set, approximately 0.73. This suggests that the model effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data, explaining around 73% of the variance in the target variable.
